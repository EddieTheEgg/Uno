## What I Learned

### Java Programming Concepts
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Created classes for `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, and `Game`
- **Collections Framework**: Used `ArrayList` for managing cards and players
- **Exception Handling**: Implemented try-catch blocks for user input validation
- **Scanner Class**: Used for reading user input from the terminal
- **HashMap**: Created color-to-emoji mappings for better card visualization
